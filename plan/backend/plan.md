# Off-Grid Living Application - Backend Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the backend implementation plan for the Off-Grid Living application. The backend will provide the necessary APIs and data management for the frontend.

## Data Model Planning
- [ ] Identify key entities (Users, Properties, Resources, etc.)
- [ ] Define relationships between entities
- [ ] Create schema drafts for each entity
- [ ] Plan API endpoints needed

## API Architecture
- [ ] Define API design principles (REST, GraphQL, etc.)
- [ ] Plan authentication and authorization mechanism
- [ ] Create endpoint structure
- [ ] Design response formats

## Backend Technology Stack
- [ ] Select server framework
- [ ] Choose database technology
- [ ] Plan file storage approach
- [ ] Define middleware requirements

## Security Strategy
- [ ] Implement authentication system
- [ ] Plan authorization rules
- [ ] Define data validation approach
- [ ] Set up CORS and other security measures

## Deployment Planning
- [ ] Choose hosting platform
- [ ] Plan CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Consider environment strategy (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Plan for monitoring and analytics

## Backend Testing Strategy
- [ ] Set up unit testing framework
- [ ] Plan integration tests
- [ ] Implement API testing approach
- [ ] Establish test coverage requirements
