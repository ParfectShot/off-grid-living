# Off-Grid Living Application - Frontend Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the frontend implementation plan for the Off-Grid Living application. The frontend is built using React with TanStack Router and React Query.

## UI/UX Design Approach
- [x] Decide on a component library or custom design system
- [ ] Establish design principles and guidelines
- [ ] Create wireframes for key screens
- [ ] Define responsive design strategy

## State Management Strategy
- [ ] Determine how to leverage React Query for server state
- [ ] Plan local state management approach
- [ ] Define caching strategies
- [ ] Create a data fetching pattern to follow

## Routing Structure
- [x] Map out application routes
  - Home (/) ✅
  - Blogs (/blogs, /blogs/[id]) ✅
  - Calculators (/calculators, /calculators/[type]) ✅
      - Calculators Index (/calculators) ✅
      - Home Load Calculator (/calculators/home-load) ✅
      - Solar System Calculator (/calculators/solar-system) ⏳
  - Reviews (/reviews, /reviews/[id])
  - Guides (/guides, /guides/[path])
- [x] Define route parameters and dynamic routes
- [ ] Plan for protected/authenticated routes
- [ ] Establish route-level data loading patterns

## Frontend Testing Strategy
- [ ] Set up component testing framework
- [ ] Plan for integration tests
- [ ] Implement UI testing approach
- [ ] Establish test coverage requirements

## Component Architecture
- [ ] Define component hierarchy
- [ ] Plan for component reusability
- [ ] Establish naming conventions
- [ ] Create shared component library
- [ ] Design progressive disclosure patterns for guides

## Performance Optimization
- [ ] Plan for code splitting
- [ ] Implement lazy loading strategy
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Define performance benchmarks

## Images and Assets
- [ ] Organize asset directory structure
- [ ] Create placeholder images for development
- [ ] Find/create high-quality images for:
  - [ ] Home page sections
  - [ ] Calculator preview cards (home load & solar system calculators)
  - [ ] Blog posts
  - [ ] Product reviews
