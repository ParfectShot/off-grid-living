# Off-Grid Living Application - Initialization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the initial setup process for the Off-Grid Living application. We're starting with a basic TanStack Router and React Query setup and will build upon it.

## Initial Setup Checklist

### 1. Project Structure Cleanup
- [x] Review and understand the current TanStack Router configuration
- [x] Review and understand the React Query integration
- [x] Identify core files that should be preserved (like router.tsx)
- [x] Create a list of default files to be removed or modified
- [x] Clear unnecessary boilerplate code while preserving routing and query functionality

### 2. Core Features Definition
- [x] Define the primary purpose of the Off-Grid Living application
- [x] List main features required for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- [x] Organize features by priority
- [x] Establish technical requirements for each feature

### 3. Data Model Planning
- [ ] Identify key entities (Users, Properties, Resources, etc.)
- [ ] Define relationships between entities
- [ ] Create schema drafts for each entity
- [ ] Plan API endpoints needed

### 4. UI/UX Design Approach
- [ ] Decide on a component library or custom design system
- [ ] Establish design principles and guidelines
- [ ] Create wireframes for key screens
- [ ] Define responsive design strategy

### 5. State Management Strategy
- [ ] Determine how to leverage React Query for server state
- [ ] Plan local state management approach
- [ ] Define caching strategies
- [ ] Create a data fetching pattern to follow

### 6. Routing Structure
- [ ] Map out application routes
- [ ] Define route parameters and dynamic routes
- [ ] Plan for protected/authenticated routes
- [ ] Establish route-level data loading patterns

### 7. Development Process
- [ ] Set up testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- [ ] Establish coding standards and conventions
- [ ] Create branch strategy for version control
- [ ] Define PR review process

### 8. Deployment Planning
- [ ] Choose hosting platform
- [ ] Plan CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Consider environment strategy (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Plan for monitoring and analytics

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Phase 1: Foundation**
   - Setup project structure
   - Implement core routing
   - Create basic layouts and templates

2. **Phase 2: Core Features**
   - Implement authentication
   - Build primary features
   - Create data management components

3. **Phase 3: Enhancement**
   - Add advanced features
   - Optimize performance
   - Improve UX

4. **Phase 4: Finalization**
   - Testing and bug fixes
   - Documentation
   - Deployment preparation

## Notes on Existing Setup

We currently have a TanStack Router with React Query integration. The router setup includes:
- Query client initialization
- Route tree configuration
- Default error and not found components

This foundation will be preserved as we build the application.

## Next Steps

After approval of this plan, we'll begin with Phase 1 by cleaning up the project structure and establishing the core architectural patterns.
