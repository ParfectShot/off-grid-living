# Off-Grid Living Application - Initialization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the initial setup process for the Off-Grid Living application. We're using a turborepo monorepo setup with a React frontend (utilizing TanStack Router and React Query) and a NestJS backend.

## Initial Setup Checklist

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- [x] Set up turborepo monorepo structure
- [x] Configure NestJS backend
- [x] Configure React frontend with TanStack Router
- [x] Set up shared packages and libraries
- [x] Implement proper workspace configuration
- [x] Configure build scripts and dependencies

### 2. Core Features Definition
- [x] Define the primary purpose of the Off-Grid Living application
- [x] List main features required for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- [x] Organize features by priority
- [x] Establish technical requirements for each feature

### 3. Data Model Planning
- [ ] Identify key entities (Users, Properties, Resources, etc.)
- [ ] Define relationships between entities
- [ ] Create schema drafts for each entity
- [ ] Plan API endpoints needed

### 4. UI/UX Design Approach
- [ ] Decide on a component library or custom design system
- [ ] Establish design principles and guidelines
- [ ] Create wireframes for key screens
- [ ] Define responsive design strategy

### 5. State Management Strategy
- [x] Determine how to leverage React Query for server state
- [ ] Plan local state management approach
- [ ] Define caching strategies
- [ ] Create a data fetching pattern to follow

### 6. Routing Structure
- [x] Map out application routes
- [ ] Define route parameters and dynamic routes
- [ ] Plan for protected/authenticated routes
- [ ] Establish route-level data loading patterns

### 7. Development Process
- [ ] Set up testing strategy (unit, integration, e2e)
- [x] Establish coding standards and conventions
- [x] Create branch strategy for version control
- [ ] Define PR review process

### 8. Deployment Planning
- [ ] Choose hosting platform
- [ ] Plan CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Consider environment strategy (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Plan for monitoring and analytics

## Monorepo Structure

Our turborepo monorepo setup consists of:

- **apps/web**: React frontend with TanStack Router and React Query
- **apps/api**: NestJS backend
- **packages/**: Shared libraries and utilities

This structure enables code sharing, consistent tooling, and coordinated versioning across our frontend and backend.

## NestJS Backend

The backend is built with NestJS, providing:
- Modern TypeScript-based architecture
- Module-based organization
- Built-in dependency injection
- Robust API development tools
- Excellent integration with various databases and services

## Next Steps

With our monorepo structure in place, we'll now focus on implementing the core features outlined in the frontend and backend plans while maintaining consistency across the application.
