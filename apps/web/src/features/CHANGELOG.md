# Feature-Based Organization Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Created Feature-Based Directory Structure**
   - Created `/features` directory with subdirectories for each major feature:
     - `/features/blogs`
     - `/features/calculators`
     - `/features/guides`
     - `/features/images`
   - Each feature directory follows a consistent structure:
     - `/components` - UI components specific to the feature
     - `/hooks` - Custom React hooks for the feature
     - `/types` - TypeScript interfaces and types
     - `/utils` - Utility functions
     - `/api` - API integrations (Convex queries/mutations)

2. **Moved Components to Feature Directories**
   - Relocated image-processing components to `/features/images/components`
   - Relocated S3-browser components to `/features/images/components`
   - Relocated guide components to `/features/guides/components`

3. **Created Index Files for Each Feature Directory**
   - Added barrel export files (index.ts) for easier imports
   - Organized types for each feature

4. **Updated Route Structure**
   - Organized dashboard routes for consistency
   - Maintained compatibility with TanStack Router

## Benefits

- **Improved organization**: Code is now organized by feature rather than by technical role
- **Better discoverability**: Easier to find related code for a specific feature
- **Increased maintainability**: Changes to one feature are isolated from others
- **Streamlined development**: New features can follow the established pattern

## Next Steps

- Continue migrating remaining components to the feature structure
- Update imports across the application to use feature paths
- Create feature-specific API functions in each feature's `/api` directory
- Document the new structure for the development team
